Press and hold the `[SHIFT+R..]` key for about a second to switch to the TeachPendant main screen without shutting down the app.

On this screen, you see the ![](.../_assets/3_switch_c.png) icon on the right side of the top title bar, which means there is more than one app running in the background.

Once again, pressing the `[SHIFT+R..]` key will display the app switch dialog box, select the icon with the left/right arrow and press the `[ENTER]` key to bring the app to the front.

To exit an app, use the exit feature of that app, for example, Xpanel has a exit button in the upper right corner of the `Diagnostics` screen.
