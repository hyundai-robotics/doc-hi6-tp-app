# 3.1 hotkey and execution way

If you assign a hotkey to a frequently used app, it is convenient because it can be executed only by pressing key on any screen.
Select the app and click the `[F2:hotkey]` button.

In the hotkey setting dialog box, press the desired `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+9` and complete the setting with the `[ENTER]` key.

If you change the startup column to boot by clicking the `[F3:startup]` toggle button, the app will automatically run when the Hi6 controller boots.

If you click the `[F3:startup]` button once again, the startup column changes to manual and auto-run is disabled.
